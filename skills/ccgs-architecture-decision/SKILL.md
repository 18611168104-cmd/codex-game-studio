# CCGS Architecture Decision

Codex adaptation of the Claude Code Game Studios `architecture-decision` workflow.

## Codex Translation Layer

- Original slash command: `/architecture-decision`
- Codex skill name: `ccgs-architecture-decision`
- Shared imported references live under: `C:\Users\18143\.codex\skills\ccgs-studio\references\repo`
- When the original workflow refers to Claude-only tools or `AskUserQuestion`, use Codex equivalents: `shell_command`, `apply_patch`, `web`, and direct concise questions to the user.
- Imported `.claude/agents`, `.claude/rules`, and `.claude/hooks` are reference material only. Use `ccgs-agent-orchestration` and `ccgs-quality-gates` for Codex-usable behavior.

## Imported Workflow

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Determine the next ADR number** by scanning `docs/architecture/` for
   existing ADRs.

2. **Gather context** by reading related code and existing ADRs.

3. **Guide the user through the decision** by asking clarifying questions if
   the title alone is not sufficient.

4. **Generate the ADR** following this format:

```markdown
# ADR-[NNNN]: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX]

## Date
[Date of decision]

## Context

### Problem Statement
[What problem are we solving? Why does this decision need to be made now?]

### Constraints
- [Technical constraints]
- [Timeline constraints]
- [Resource constraints]
- [Compatibility requirements]

### Requirements
- [Must support X]
- [Must perform within Y budget]
- [Must integrate with Z]

## Decision

[The specific technical decision made, described in enough detail for someone
to implement it.]

### Architecture Diagram
[ASCII diagram or description of the system architecture this creates]

### Key Interfaces
[API contracts or interface definitions this decision creates]

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: [Name]
- **Description**: [How this would work]
- **Pros**: [Advantages]
- **Cons**: [Disadvantages]
- **Rejection Reason**: [Why this was not chosen]

### Alternative 2: [Name]
- **Description**: [How this would work]
- **Pros**: [Advantages]
- **Cons**: [Disadvantages]
- **Rejection Reason**: [Why this was not chosen]

## Consequences

### Positive
- [Good outcomes of this decision]

### Negative
- [Trade-offs and costs accepted]

### Risks
- [Things that could go wrong]
- [Mitigation for each risk]

## Performance Implications
- **CPU**: [Expected impact]
- **Memory**: [Expected impact]
- **Load Time**: [Expected impact]
- **Network**: [Expected impact, if applicable]

## Migration Plan
[If this changes existing code, how do we get from here to there?]

## Validation Criteria
[How will we know this decision was correct? What metrics or tests?]

## Related Decisions
- [Links to related ADRs]
- [Links to related design documents]
```

5. **Save the ADR** to `docs/architecture/adr-[NNNN]-[slug].md`.
