# CCGS Code Review

Codex adaptation of the Claude Code Game Studios `code-review` workflow.

## Codex Translation Layer

- Original slash command: `/code-review`
- Codex skill name: `ccgs-code-review`
- Shared imported references live under: `C:\Users\18143\.codex\skills\ccgs-studio\references\repo`
- When the original workflow refers to Claude-only tools or `AskUserQuestion`, use Codex equivalents: `shell_command`, `apply_patch`, `web`, and direct concise questions to the user.
- Imported `.claude/agents`, `.claude/rules`, and `.claude/hooks` are reference material only. Use `ccgs-agent-orchestration` and `ccgs-quality-gates` for Codex-usable behavior.

## Imported Workflow

When this skill is invoked:

1. **Read the target file(s)** in full.

2. **Read the CLAUDE.md** for project coding standards.

3. **Identify the system category** (engine, gameplay, AI, networking, UI, tools)
   and apply category-specific standards.

4. **Evaluate against coding standards**:
   - [ ] Public methods and classes have doc comments
   - [ ] Cyclomatic complexity under 10 per method
   - [ ] No method exceeds 40 lines (excluding data declarations)
   - [ ] Dependencies are injected (no static singletons for game state)
   - [ ] Configuration values loaded from data files
   - [ ] Systems expose interfaces (not concrete class dependencies)

5. **Check architectural compliance**:
   - [ ] Correct dependency direction (engine <- gameplay, not reverse)
   - [ ] No circular dependencies between modules
   - [ ] Proper layer separation (UI does not own game state)
   - [ ] Events/signals used for cross-system communication
   - [ ] Consistent with established patterns in the codebase

6. **Check SOLID compliance**:
   - [ ] Single Responsibility: Each class has one reason to change
   - [ ] Open/Closed: Extendable without modification
   - [ ] Liskov Substitution: Subtypes substitutable for base types
   - [ ] Interface Segregation: No fat interfaces
   - [ ] Dependency Inversion: Depends on abstractions, not concretions

7. **Check for common game development issues**:
   - [ ] Frame-rate independence (delta time usage)
   - [ ] No allocations in hot paths (update loops)
   - [ ] Proper null/empty state handling
   - [ ] Thread safety where required
   - [ ] Resource cleanup (no leaks)

8. **Output the review** in this format:

```
## Code Review: [File/System Name]

### Standards Compliance: [X/6 passing]
[List failures with line references]

### Architecture: [CLEAN / MINOR ISSUES / VIOLATIONS FOUND]
[List specific architectural concerns]

### SOLID: [COMPLIANT / ISSUES FOUND]
[List specific violations]

### Game-Specific Concerns
[List game development specific issues]

### Positive Observations
[What is done well -- always include this section]

### Required Changes
[Must-fix items before approval]

### Suggestions
[Nice-to-have improvements]

### Verdict: [APPROVED / APPROVED WITH SUGGESTIONS / CHANGES REQUIRED]
```
