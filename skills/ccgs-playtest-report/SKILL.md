# CCGS Playtest Report

Codex adaptation of the Claude Code Game Studios `playtest-report` workflow.

## Codex Translation Layer

- Original slash command: `/playtest-report`
- Codex skill name: `ccgs-playtest-report`
- Shared imported references live under: `C:\Users\18143\.codex\skills\ccgs-studio\references\repo`
- When the original workflow refers to Claude-only tools or `AskUserQuestion`, use Codex equivalents: `shell_command`, `apply_patch`, `web`, and direct concise questions to the user.
- Imported `.claude/agents`, `.claude/rules`, and `.claude/hooks` are reference material only. Use `ccgs-agent-orchestration` and `ccgs-quality-gates` for Codex-usable behavior.
